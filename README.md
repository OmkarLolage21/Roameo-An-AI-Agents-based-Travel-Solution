## Features

- **Personalized Travel Recommendations:** AI analyzes user preferences to suggest destinations, activities, and accommodations.
- **Automated Itinerary Generation:** Generates day-by-day plans based on user interests, time, and budget.
- **Conversational Agent:** Chat interface for queries, booking assistance, and support.
- **Booking Integration:** API connections to hotels, flights, and activity providers.
- **Real-time Updates:** Notifies users of changes, delays, and opportunities during travel.
- **Collaborative Planning:** Allows group planning and agent negotiation for optimal itineraries.

## Architecture

Roameo is a modular, service-oriented application with the following core components:

- **Frontend (TypeScript/React):** User-facing interface for interacting with AI agents, viewing itineraries, and managing bookings.
- **Backend (Python/FastAPI):** Hosts AI logic, manages data, orchestrates agent communication, and integrates external APIs.
- **AI Agent Layer:** Implements multiple specialized agents for recommendation, planning, booking, and support.
- **Database:** Stores user profiles, itineraries, and booking histories.
- **External Integrations:** Connects to travel APIs (e.g., hotel, flight, activity providers).

## AI Agents & Capabilities

Roameo’s intelligence comes from a suite of AI agents, each specializing in a domain:

- **Recommendation Agent:** Analyzes preferences, trends, and reviews.
- **Planning Agent:** Builds itineraries, optimizes schedules.
- **Booking Agent:** Automates reservations, handles payments.
- **Support Agent:** Provides real-time help and answers questions.
- **Negotiation Agent:** Facilitates group trip planning and consensus.

Agents communicate via an orchestrator module, leveraging natural language processing and reasoning algorithms.
